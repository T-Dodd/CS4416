# Instructions
The program is run through the Main.java class in the src folder "src/Main.Java". To use, select a file with the select file button. Then, click scan to scan the file for unsafe functions. The edit functions button opens a window that allows disabling and enabling which functions are scanned for. Currently, the program only supports C source code for language recognition. The program may run when given a text file that is not C source code, but the results are undefined and unknown. The program will read the full length file path specified by the user.
