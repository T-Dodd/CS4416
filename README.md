# Instructions
The program is run through the Main.java class in the src folder "src/Main.Java". When the program runs it will prompt the user for a file path. Currently, the program only supports C source code for language recognition. The program may run when given a text file that is not C source code, but the results are undefined and unknown. The program will read the full length file path specified by the user, or alternatively the user may simply press enter, in which case the program will execute on the default C source file included.
